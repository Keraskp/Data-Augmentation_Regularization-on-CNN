# Data-Augmentation_Regularization-on-CNN :
### Applying **Data Augmentation** and **Regularization** techniques on CIFAR-10 Dataset to improve performance of Convolutional Neural Network

### CIFAR-10
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The 10 classes are airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.


### Convolutional Neural Network :
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

A CNN architecture consists of 3 types of layers :

- **Convolution Layer** : It is responsible for the extraction of the different features from the input images. The convolution mathematical operation is done between the input image and a filter of a specific size MxM in this layer.

- **Pooling Layer** : The Pooling layer is responsible for the reduction of size of the Colvolved feature.


- **Fully connected Layer** : It takes the output of the convolution process and predicts the imageâ€™s class based on the features retrieved earlier.
